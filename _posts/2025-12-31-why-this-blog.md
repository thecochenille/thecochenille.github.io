title: "Day Zero: The Philosophy of the Quiet Build"

Today marks the start of a new technical chapter.

In a year of AI overwhelm and rapid tool releases, I found my focus by deciding to slow down. I believe the path to building valuable AI products lies in understanding the architecture beneath the hype.

For 2026, I am embracing The Quiet Build. This lab notebook will document my deep dive into MLOps and System Design as I architect a foundational platform for my family’s heritage

### Why now?
My path to this project isn't linear. I spent years as a Research Scientist in evolutionary biology before pivoting into Data Science a year and a half ago. After my first year in the corporate world, I’ve seen the industry-wide rush to build AI tools as quickly as possible, and this often at the expense of system integrity.

Coming from an evolutionary background, I understand that for a system to survive and be "fit" for the long term, it needs a stable foundation and a clear architecture. I am using 2026 to slow down and bridge the gap between "working code" and "mature engineering."

I am using this space to:

1. Master **ML Systems Design** through a rigorous reading track.
2. Build a **Foundational System** on GCP that preserves family history.
3. Document every architectural choice as an **ADR** (Architecture Decision Record).

This is a lab notebook for one project at a time. Let's begin.
