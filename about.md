## The Approach
**The Quiet Build** is a technical archive dedicated to the intersection of MLOps architecture, foundational system design and a ground for building intentionally. 

I believe in:
* **Quality over Hype:** Moving past the "newest" tool to understand the underlying architecture.
* **Intentionality:** Building one robust project at a time to ensure depth and durability.
* **Robustness:** Creating systems that are sustainable, maintainable, and well-documented.
* **Applied Learning:** I believe the best way to master complex systems is to build them. This archive is a transparent record of that education—documenting the gaps in my knowledge as I work to bridge them.

## 2026 Focus
I am taking a deep dive into ML Systems Design and applying those principles to a Family Heritage MLOps Platform. This project uses a serverless GCP stack to digitize and archive family history, creating an intelligent interface that allows for deep exploration and discovery across historical records.

## The Methodology
This blog will be a "lab notebook" for my transition into senior-level MLOps engineering, documenting not just the final code, but the thought process in designing systems, my architectural decisions and the failures along the way.
