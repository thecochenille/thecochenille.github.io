title: The Quiet Build

Welcome to the Quiet Build, a collection of documents focusing on building AI products using robust system design principles.

## 2026 Project: Family Heritage MLOps
I am currently architecting a serverless platform on GCP to digitize and interact with family history records.
- **Goal:** Transform unstructured family letters and photos into a durable, searchable digital archive with an intelligent interface for historical discovery.
- **Principles:** Zero-cost-at-rest architecture, data privacy, and modular system design.

## Reading Track (Q1 2026)
To ensure depth and architectural rigor, I am limiting my theoretical focus to two core resources this quarter. This allows for deep reflection and the integration of concepts into my actual build process.

- **Designing Machine Learning Systems by Chip Huyen:** For mastering the technical trade-offs in data engineering, model selection, and system reliability.
- **Humanizing AI Strategy by Tienkai Feng:** For ensuring the system remains user-centric and respects the nuances of family heritage.

**The Process:** For every major building block in the Family Heritage Platform, I will publish a "Decision Record" post on this blog explaining how concepts from these texts influenced the design.
